# Wager Functionality Restored

## Problem Identified
The wager functionality was missing from the challenge flow because the bot was using a simplified `challenge_command` that bypassed the conversation handler system entirely. The wager system was fully implemented but not connected to the user interface.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Challenge Command Conversion
- **Before**: Simple command that created challenges with 0 wager directly
- **After**: Conversation-based command that asks users if they want to wager marbles

### 2. Conversation Handler Setup
- Added proper ConversationHandler in `main.py`
- Connected wager callback handlers
- Implemented proper conversation flow states

### 3. Updated Flow
The new challenge flow now works as follows:

1. User types `/challenge @username`
2. Bot asks: "Do you want to wager marbles on this battle?"
   - **Yes, wager marbles! 💰** → Asks for wager amount
   - **No, just for fun! 🎮** → Creates challenge with 0 wager
3. If wagering, user types amount (1-1000 marbles)
4. Challenge is created and sent to the challenged user
5. Challenged user can accept/decline as before

## Files Modified

### `marbitz_battlebot/handlers.py`
- Updated `challenge_command()` to use conversation flow
- Fixed `wager_callback()` to handle new callback format
- Updated `wager_amount_handler()` to properly end conversation

### `main.py`
- Added ConversationHandler import
- Created challenge conversation handler
- Replaced simple CommandHandler with ConversationHandler

## Testing

### Backend Testing
✅ Created and ran `test_wager_flow.py` - all tests pass:
- Challenge creation with wager amounts
- Wager amount updates
- Zero-wager challenges
- Data persistence and retrieval

### User Interface Testing
To test the complete user flow:

1. Start the bot
2. Use `/challenge @username` command
3. You should now see wager options:
   ```
   ⚔️ Challenge created against @username!
   
   💰 Do you want to wager marbles on this battle?
   [Yes, wager marbles! 💰] [No, just for fun! 🎮]
   ```

4. If you choose "Yes":
   - Bot asks for wager amount
   - Type a number (e.g., "50")
   - Challenge is created with wager

5. If you choose "No":
   - Challenge is created with 0 wager immediately

## Features Restored

✅ **Wager Selection**: Users can choose to wager or not  
✅ **Wager Amount Input**: Users can specify 1-1000 marbles  
✅ **Wager Display**: Challenges show wager amounts  
✅ **Battle Resolution**: Winners receive wagered marbles  
✅ **Leaderboard Integration**: Wager amounts affect rankings  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error messages  

## Conversation States

- `WAGER_AMOUNT`: Waiting for wager decision or amount input
- Conversation ends when challenge is created and active

## Callback Patterns

- `wager_yes_{challenge_id}`: User wants to wager
- `wager_no_{challenge_id}`: User doesn't want to wager
- `accept_{challenge_id}`: Accept challenge (existing)
- `decline_{challenge_id}`: Decline challenge (existing)

The wager functionality is now fully restored and integrated into the challenge flow!# Wager Functionality Restored
